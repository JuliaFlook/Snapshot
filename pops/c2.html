<h1>Compliance Simplified</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p><strong>Met institutional requirements invisibly without disrupting the user experience.</strong></p>
  <p>I embed compliance into tools and templates so faculty can meet institutional requirements without shifting focus to checklists or guidelines. The design does the heavy lifting, letting instructors stay focused on teaching while still staying aligned.</p>
