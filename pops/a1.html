<h1>Systems Thinking</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p><strong>Sees the whole picture and builds clarity from complexity.</strong></p>
  <p>I think in systems. I naturally zoom out, see how parts connect, and spot friction or inefficiency quickly. I bring order to complexity by shaping information, goals, and user experience into a clear, functional whole that’s intuitive, efficient, and easy to use. Give me something messy or confusing to fix, and I'm in my zone.</p>
