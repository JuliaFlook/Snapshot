<h1>Cognitive Load</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p><strong>Conserves mental energy by removing distractions, simplifying pathways, and easing cognitive strain.</strong></p>
  <p>I design with respect for the brain’s limited capacity. I cut excess content, strip out avoidable complexity, and deliver information in crisp, scannable chunks. Every choice reduces friction and keeps users sharp, confident, and in control.</p>
