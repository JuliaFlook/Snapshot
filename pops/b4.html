<h1> Flow Optimization</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p><strong>Improves content flow and structure to support focused, uninterrupted learning.</strong></p>
  <p>I streamline content flow to keep users engaged and on track. I fix poor sequencing, vague instructions, and broken connections that slow people down or pull them off course. The result is a smooth, intuitive experience that reduces confusion and keeps momentum going.</p>
